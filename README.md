## iOSimDebugLauncher
A productivity tool to launch Safari debugger that is hooked to an iOS simulator's browser or hybrid mobile app. By default, the app hooks to `index.html` and closes all running Safari windows. You don't need to launch Safari, but the page on the simulator needs to be running.
